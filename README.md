# lb-list-to-json
Convert Letterboxd lists to json files, done using web scraping as the Letterboxd API is unavailable.
Used to update the json files for koenhagen's web script that adds the top 2000 movies to letterboxd's movie data:

https://github.com/koenhagen/lb-top-2000

https://github.com/frozenpandaman/letterboxd-userscripts

The script "Crown_fire_and_movie_icon_rankings.user.js" contains the top 2000 highest rated films, top 2000+ most watched films (i.e. films with more than 100,000 watches), and the ranking of the film's place in Prof. Ratigan's Top 5000 films of all time:
